# Rebirth: The Bunker

This is a procedurally generated attempted reaction of the upcoming Amnesia: The Bunker which was made during the 2023 Frictional Winter Monster Jam.

Considering this uses a lot of procedural generation and random values, bugs are to be expected. Enemies have a broken navmesh as unfortunately navmesh edits after map creation are only available through source code which I do not have access to.

Ready to play? Here are the basics! -
While exploring an abandoned WW1 bunker, the door you came from gets caved in.
Overcome fear, persevere, and make your way out alive.
Don't get close to noisy holes - Don't go insane - Find the key and escape.
