	<Entry Name="Readable_EncyclopediaEntry">ALGERIA (contd.)[br][br]The colonization of Algeria was rendered difficult by the presence of a native population which already had its own civilization, and was nomad and warlike in its instincts. A start was made in the region of the Tell, and then the mountains and high plateau lands were taken in hand. There has been a spontaneous flow of Italian and Spanish immigration, and a system of land grants and other concessions have attracted large numbers of immigrants from the south of France who have settled down well in the country. Between 1904 and 1914, 206,000 hectares of land had been settled, of which 91,200 were free grants.[br][br]Mines.- The country is rich in minerals, which, however, have not been thoroughly exploited. The chief mineral resource is iron, the exports of which in 1920 amounted to 1,114,438 tons, valued at 33.879,000 francs. There are large phosphate deposits in the Constantine province, which exported 334,704 tons in 1920 to a value of 18 million francs. There are also copper, zinc, lead, and antimony mines. Coal deposits were discovered during the war, and the work of British and American prospectors in the Oran indicates the possibility of existence of oil fields of some size.[br][br]Native rights.- The valuable help given by the native population of Algiers to France during the World War led, as it did in other parts of the French colonial empire, to a wider recognition of the political rights of the native. A law was passed, Feb. 4 1919, con- ferring French citizenship on any native of Algeria who had either served in the French army or navy, was a land-owner, farmer, or licensed trader, knew how to read and write French, or was the possessor of a French decoration.</Entry>

Is this whole world frozen in a moment after its destruction?[br][br]How could I ever tell, and what would change if I knew the answer?[br][br]I have given up on the attempt to find the portal.

But I have no means to proceed.[br][br]The Traveller's Amulet, according to Weyer, should focus these energies and provoke the weak points to tear open, forming a rift between this world and another. But I have no amulet.[br][br]If I remember his treatise, rifts can form without an amulet, but that is down to the alignment of the spheres and their stars.

She was sad because she wanted a child.[br][br]She asked her wise people to help, but they said "Why do you want a child? We are all your children!"[br][br]"I must have a baby," she said, "because I cannot be queen forever, and someone must be queen after me!"[br][br]"Nonsense," said the wise people. "We will brew you a magic potion, and then you will live forever. You will always be our Queen."[br][br]So that is what they did. But, sometimes, when she was alone, the Queen cried, because although she was mother to the world, it was not enough.</Entry>

	<Entry Name="Readable_TasisOasisNote">4th March 1937[br][br]I am Tasi Trianon. I survived the crash of the plane Cassandra. With me are Hank Mitchell, Yasmin Chabani, Dr Anton Metzier, Leon De Vries, and Malick Tamboura.[br][br]My husband Salim and others are in a cave near the crash, and need help.[br][br]Some have died. Richard Fairchild could not handle what we saw here; he ran. Alex Sterling has gone after him. We can't wait. We must do something that is utter insanity.[br][br]Hank Mitchell, our leader and my friend, was badly wounded by a creature in the fort. Yasmin calls it a ghûl, a flesh-eating monster from desert legends. She may be right.[br][br]Hank is losing blood fast, and he will die. There is no time to get to help.[br][br]There is a shrine here to a local spirit. This will sound like madness: she appeared to us. A figure of glowing light. She spoke to us. She offered healing, and to save us from the desert. And I, I agreed![br][br]She led us to an amulet, hidden in the shrine. I took it. Now there is a shimmering doorway in the rock. I swear it wasn't there before. If we step through, Hank might live.[br][br]He is so pale.[br][br]Oh Salim, I don't know what else to do? This is crazy! But I promise, I promise I will return to you.</Entry>

Sure she'll cope in the field - this is not a difficult trip, we've been on much worse - but the last year has been hell for her. That call from Paris... she sounded so broken.[br][br]Guess all I can do is look out for her, try to keep her busy. Need to prod Malick and Rachael to do the same.[br][br]She's got Salim here too, which will help. I really, really hope this is what she needs - that it can start mending things for her. For both of them.</Entry>

		<Entry Name="HanksNote_Salim">Salim Hannachi[br]Guide/3rd Gun[br]Papers: Not needed - Algerian.[br]Travel From: Le Bourget[br][br]Good to have Salim back with us, despite circumstances. Must remember Tasi's not the only one hurt by all of this; he's always quiet, might be hard to notice. Note - talk to Malick, so he can keep an eye.[br][br]Been a rough year. I had to talk up how dangerous Sudan is a bit with Sterling - we didn't really need a third gun, but Tasi and Salim need to be together right now.</Entry>

  		<Entry Name="HanksNote_Doctor">Dr Anton Metzier[br]Doctor[br]Papers: Swiss, will need a Visa.[br]Travel From: Basel[br][br]Sterling Senior insisted we have a doctor on the expedition because his 'people' don't trust the locals. Told him this was a week at Kayes, not three months in the jungle, but he wouldn't hear it.[br][br]So they sent us this guy. Don't know much about him, but they must be paying him a lot to leave a practice in Switzerland.  Guess he's competent. Whether he can cope with Africa - we'll see.</Entry>

  		<Entry Name="HanksNote_Sterling">Alexander Melville Sterling[br]The Money[br]Papers: British, will need a Visa.[br]Travel From: Croydon, with us.[br][br]Alex Sterling, son of Robert Sterling. He's the money. Coming with us to feel like the big boss man and have an adventure, I reckon.[br][br]Met up with him in Mayfair. Cheerful and charming and willing to get along and swears he'll know his place and follow all our advice. Yeah. Will believe it when I see it.[br][br]Maybe leave wrangling to Rachael? She knows how to navigate the British upper classes. Need to keep him sweet, but no special treatment. Can't travel without his private secretary - not a great start!</Entry>

What's Sterling planning to do, write a book?[br][br]Seems like dead weight. Pale kinda fella who looks like he'd run a mile if a gazelle coughed at him. Said he'd like to try his hand at hunting, but I can't see him hurting a fly.[br][br]Same as Sterling, I guess - make sure he feels part of the expedition, but no special treatment.</Entry>

Malick's handling forward prep as usual, buying in supply lists and such - remind Rachael to wire any extra needs to him in Algiers.[br][br]Make sure to introduce him to Rachael early on - he can be good backup, stop her doing something stupid (same as he's done for me a million times). Also talk through the Tasi situation with him - he'll do anything for her, even if she doesn't know it.</Entry>

Met in London - has worked on a ton of projects, but never outside England. Nice guy, but like an excited puppy! Desperate to have a proper taste of Africa.[br][br]He'll work well with Tasi and Eva, but we need to make sure Leon doesn't steamroller him.</Entry>

She likes everyone, so tread carefully here.[br][br]Wants to do some hunting while we're in Sudan. Can't see that as a problem, so long as it doesn't get in the way.</Entry>

Meet him and hostess (Yasmin) at Maison Blanche, Wednesday 3rd.[br][br]Is this Masson from Morocco trip in '33? If so, damn good pilot, but could charm the skin off a snake. Warn Rachael!</Entry>
